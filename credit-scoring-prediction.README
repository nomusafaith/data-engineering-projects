## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Databricks Community Edition account
- Basic Python/pandas knowledge
- Sample banking dataset

### Quick Start:
1. Upload `bank_loan_modelling` data to Databricks
2. Run notebooks in sequence (1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
3. View interactive dashboards in Notebook 4
4. Export to Power BI for business reporting

### Sample Usage:
```python
# Real-time scoring example
scorer = RealTimeCreditScorer(models, categorical_features, numerical_features)
application = {
    'Age': 35, 'Income': 120000, 'Experience': 10, 
    'CCAvg': 3.2, 'Education': 3
}
result = scorer.score_application(application)
# Returns: Risk score, recommendation, and key factors
```
