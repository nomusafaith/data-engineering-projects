- Cleans and transforms data using **Python & Pandas**  
- Stores data efficiently in **Delta Lake** for scalable queries  
- Generates **interactive 12-month forecasts** using **Holt-Winters**  
- Supports **multi-stock automation** with parameterized functions  

The pipeline demonstrates a full **data engineering workflow** from extraction to visualization and automation.
